Lektor is an [Open Source Project](../license/) and freely available to
download.  It's currently still under heavy development and not all platforms
are equally well supported.

## Command Line Interface

If you are on Linux or Mac you can install the command line version of
Lektor by copy/pasting a command into your terminal.

!!! Scared about copy/pasting this into a terminal?  We will not do anything
before asking you for confirmation and you can download the script upfront
to see what it's doing.

### Mac/Linux

This will install Lektor for you but you might have to run it with `sudo` if
your current user does not have rights to write into `/usr/local`.

```
curl -sf https://www.getlektor.com/install.sh | sh
```

You might need additional dependencies for this installation.  For more
information see [Installation](../docs/installation/).

### Windows

If you are on Windows copy/paste this command into the `command prompt`:

```
@powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "iex ((new-object net.webclient).DownloadString('https://getlektor.com/install.ps1'))" && SET PATH=%PATH%;%LocalAppData%\lektor-cli
```

alternatively use this command in your `Powershell`:

```
iex ((new-object net.webclient).DownloadString('https://getlektor.com/install.ps1'))
```

## Desktop Application

If you are on OS X you are in luck because you can use an installable
version of Lektor that comes with a graphical user interface.  It also
includes the command line utilities.
